## Project Overview

The **Arena Challenge** is a fictional gaming fitness competition platform inspired by _Squid Game_. It introduces players to various games, arenas, and organizers, with options to join and participate in the challenge. The website is designed as a modern landing page, offering a bold and intense experience.

The color palette of the website was inspired by the striking colors used in the _Squid Game_ series, which include dark tones combined with bright, contrasting colors to create an immersive and high-stakes atmosphere. These color choices enhance the feeling of competition and urgency, similar to the show's visual style.

You can see the color palette I used below:
